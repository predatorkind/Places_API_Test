# Places API Test
Check nearby places of interest relative to your location.
## Description
This application utilizes Google Geocode and Places APIs to obtain names and addresses of places of interest within certain distance from a given location.
## Installation
There is not much to the installation process. The project consists of a single .py file. There are no specific requirements to run the file as it only uses python built-in libraries.
You need to have Python installed on your machine to execute .py files.
Additionally, Maps API Key is required to use both Geocode and Places APIs. The code by default looks for the API key inside "MapsAPIKey" environment variable.
## Usage
Simply run placesTest.py file to start the application; follow on screen prompts by first entering your location and then selecting one of the options to search for nearby places of interest. 
## Credits
This simple app was inspired by following the Python for Everybody course by Dr. Charles Severance that can be accessed on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).
